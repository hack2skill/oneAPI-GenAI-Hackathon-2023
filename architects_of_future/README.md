# Problem Statement
For legal professionals, staying updated with the latest laws and judgments can be a challenging task. According to LexusNexus research, nearly 65 percent of a lawyer's time is dedicated solely to legal research on relevant laws. Additionally, grappling with lengthy verdicts and chargesheets is a time-consuming and arduous process. The preparation of legal documents is also a taxing task that demands meticulous attention. In response to these challenges, we have undertaken a project to develop a smart Legal Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned on legal data, capable of addressing the aforementioned issues. This article will provide an in-depth exploration of our project, highlighting key components and technologies that have facilitated the development of an effective solution.

The main goal of our project was to fine-tune a large language model using legal datasets. The aim was for the model to assimilate recent changes, enabling it to provide accurate guidance to lawyers by extracting relevant laws and facilitating a comprehensive understanding of extensive documents, with the ability to summarize key points effectively. During the training process, we were impressed by the efficiency of the Intel Developer Cloud, particularly the impactful performance of the AI Analytics Toolkit. The optimization of pandas and numpy by Intel significantly enhanced processing speed, surpassing our expectations. Additionally, the efficiency of quantization with OpenVino NNCF was a pleasant surprise, contributing to faster inference capabilities.

# Description
We employed the Zephyr-7b-beta model, surpassing many larger models of its kind in terms of performance. Despite its enhanced capabilities, controlling its proclivity for hallucinations proved to be challenging. Extensive training was conducted using a substantial synthetic dataset gathered from diverse platforms, including large language model completion datasets, open-source information, and legal databases. This exhaustive training equipped the model with comprehensive knowledge of Indian laws, recent developments, significant judgments, and more.

# Intel AI analytics toolkit in Data preprocessing 
The synthetically collected dataset have to be extensively preprocessed before sending to LLM for training. Here we have used Intel optimized Pandas and NumPy. This have improved the speed to multifold, made even CPU computation so powerfulÂ .It made the program utilize all the cores in CPU instead of leaving them idle. just change in a line have improved our efficiency multifold.

# Intel AI analytics toolkit in training
In the training process, we utilized the same foundational model, enriching it with extensive knowledge of Indian laws and crucial legal cases. Subsequently, this base model underwent separate training for three distinct tasks: summarizing legal documents and generating new legal content.
We have tried with different models like Mistral 7b, llama2 13b, Flang T5, and Zephyr 7b, and codes used for finetuning these models in both idc and colab are attached. Some have not provided better results, some have crashed in idc, because of model size and dataset size.Finally, We have decided to finetune a Zephyr 7B BETA quantized model in GPTQ format as GGML format models are not trainable, and trainig entire model became impractical at that odd hour.
The implementation of Intel optimized PyTorch significantly enhanced code optimization. Despite the unfortunate loss of our trained model due to a system crash at IDC, the evident reduction in training loss underscored the success of our efforts. The step-by-step guidance provided for fine-tuning the Large Language Model (LLM) through peft LORA proved to be exceptionally beneficial.

# Post training Quantization ![image](https://github.com/Sriram-code/Intel-Hackathon/assets/75485469/2574a6b1-9b54-470c-a444-24eb0633768d)
Leveraging a large Language Model for inference poses challenges, and the OpenVINO Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF) method for quantization proves to be an excellent solution. The detailed steps outlined in notebook 254, available in the training folder, were instrumental for post-training quantization. In a trial run, we applied this method to the actual Zephyr 7b beta model without further training. The model was successfully converted to INT8 format using only the CPU, resulting in a streamlined 6 GB bin-sized model. This transformation significantly accelerated the inference process without any discernible drop in performance and later in discord, it is stated that usage of Openvino toolkit is prohibited, so this model is not utilized and code used for quantizing the model in IDC is attached.

# Experiments:
Various models, including Llama2, Flang T5, Mistral 7b, and Zephyr 7b, were explored for summarization and data generation. Despite encountering several challenges, the Zephyr 7b model emerged as the preferred choice due to its superior performance compared to other models of similar size.

# Usecase of Intel Developer cloud
The Intel Developer Cloud proves to be an excellent platform, offering access to powerful CPUs and high-speed internet, thereby facilitating a remarkably swift process. This challenges the misconception that LLM training necessitates GPU usage. The experimentation phase demonstrated that faster inferencing and training are achievable with different models on this platform.

For our misfortune at last moment when we trained the model with actual data, it got disconnected, which made us not use it at present, and the codes and screenshots are attached and the model is trained on other platform as per suggestion of intel team.

Our model is now proficient in addressing inquiries related to Indian law, referencing crucial legal judgments, and comprehending and elucidating the nuances inherent in various laws and acts. Notably, it achieves this with significantly reduced inference time, providing efficient and accurate responses. The notebook named Simple inferencing with LLM and simple RAG chatbot in training notebooks proved to be very helpful while performing these activities.

    from intel_extension_for_transformers.neural_chat import build_chatbot
    chatbot = build_chatbot()
    response = chatbot.predict("Tell me about Intel Xeon Scalable Processors.")

    from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TextStreamer
    from intel_extension_for_transformers.transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
    model_name = "HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta"     
    prompt = "Once upon a time, there existed a little girl,"

    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
    streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer)

    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, load_in_8bit=True)
    outputs = model.generate(inputs, streamer=streamer, max_new_tokens=500)

these small changes have improved the performance very well

2. Chat with PDF
  Introducing an advanced feature for our application: the capability to streamline the extraction and analysis of information from lengthy and intricate PDF documents. Users can effortlessly upload their documents, and our system will intelligently parse the content, breaking it down into manageable chunks. These chunks are then embedded and stored in a vector format, creating a sophisticated knowledge repository.
When users pose questions, the application efficiently retrieves and presents the pertinent content chunks. These are seamlessly fed into a Language Model (LLM) to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. This innovative approach not only enhances the user experience by saving time and effort but also ensures that the Language Model is grounded in the latest and most relevant information.
Furthermore, our application is optimized with cutting-edge Intel libraries, ensuring unparalleled performance and efficiency.
